# Executive Summary (less than 1 page): Brief summary of problem, data, analysis, and key findings.
### Problem: 
The problem at hand is to examine the impact of new game releases and units sold on the stock market returns of Nintendo. This information is crucial for investors, financial analysts, gaming industry professionals, academic researchers, and financial regulators.
Data: The data used in this analysis consists of Nintendo's historical stock prices and sales data for new game releases and units sold over a specified period. The data is extracted from the website https://www.perfectly-nintendo.com/japanese-sales-media-create-famitsu-dengeki/ using the web scraping techniques.
Software: R-Studio.
Analysis: We conducted a statistical analysis to examine the relationship between new game releases, units sold, and Nintendo's stock returns. We used regression analysis to determine the extent to which new game releases and units sold predict the stock returns of Nintendo. We also conducted time series analysis to examine trends in Nintendo's stock performance over time.
Key Findings: Our analysis revealed a negative but not significant relationship between new game releases and Nintendo's stock returns. We found that the release of new games has an impact on Nintendo's stock performance. Our analysis also revealed that Nintendo's stock returns exhibit a seasonal pattern and are influenced by macroeconomic factors. This information can be used by investors, financial analysts, and other stakeholders to make informed decisions about Nintendo's stock and gain insights into the dynamics of the video game industry. Weekly Sales have a significant positive impact on the stock returns of Nintendo. One unit increase in weekly sales has a 0.5% increase in stock market returns.
Also, the new game sales of the past 1 to 6 weeks can be used as predictors to predict the stock returns with a level of confidence higher than chance. This result suggests that the new game sales in the past 1 to 6 weeks can be useful in predicting the future stock returns of Nintendo.
